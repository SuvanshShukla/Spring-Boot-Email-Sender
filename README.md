# Spring-Boot-Email-Sender


This project was made using Spring Boot. Written mostly in Java. 
Its main purpose was to help me learn how to send an email using Spring Boot, and later on how to add inline images in the same email.

I used multiple links and videos to help me learn this. I will try to link them if I remember.


### To run this project
- simply clone this repo to where ever you want on your computer
- then open the email-demo folder using an IDE (preferably IntelliJ)
- then run the project by running its main method 
- before running the project you will need to correctly fill in the details of the application.properties file
- then you must enter the correct "to" and "from" fields in the SendEmailService.java file
- after entering the correct fields you should be able to run it 
- when you run it you should see a message -> "Mail Sent..."
- upon seeing the message, it means that the program worked
